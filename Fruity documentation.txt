					Fruity Grocery store
The fruity Grocery store form is a document to collect user reviews of the product and services offered by the store
It coolects user personal data together with their opinions and suggetions.
Despite being able to collect massive data I chose this kind of form because it can take many different input types on the same page.
Alongside this documentation attached are these files:-
      1.fruityhtml - the Html file of the form.
      2.fruitycss -  the css stylying file of the form.
      3.fruityvalidation - the javascript validation file for the form.
      4.Fruity Documentation - the documentation file (this file)
